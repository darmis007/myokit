# Using Myokit

This page lists example notebooks showing how Myokit can be used in a variety of applications, ranging from cellular to sub-cellular to tissue simulations.
They accompany the full Myokit documentation provided on [https://myokit.readthedocs.io](https://myokit.readthedocs.io).



Please note this page is still a work in progress, and many more examples are yet to be added



## The basics

1. [Simulating an action potential](./basics-simulating-an-action-potential.ipynb)
2. [Selecting variables to log](basics-selecting-variables.ipynb)

3. Starting, stopping, pre-pacing, and loops
    - Changing variables
    - Defining protocols





## Somewhere down the line
